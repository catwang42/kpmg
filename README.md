Some Thoughts

1. Run web crawler with beautiful soup to scrap relevant information, resource: analytics reporting website, linkedin employee, tech news, google search news 
2. store data into mangoBD
3. try to use MEAN stack do visulisation (mangoBD, express.js, angular.js, node.js)
4. use NLPT, Deep learning for text analysis , SimRank, word2vec
5. trend, relavance, profile, score in different industry (EDA)
6. prediction (reputation score in next 5 years / employee flow)
